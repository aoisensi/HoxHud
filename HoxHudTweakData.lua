This is the configuration file for HoxHud. Please be careful editing values as you can cause the game to crash upon loading if a value is made invalid

We recommend colorpicker.com if you want to choose a color to use. The game also has some predefined colors and they are used here purely for brevity.

Only the following Colors are defined explicitly:
Color.red (FF0000), Color.green(00FF00), Color.blue (0000FF), Color.cyan (0000FF), Color.purple(FF00FF), Color.black (000000), Color.white (FFFFFF), Color.yellow (FFFF00)
